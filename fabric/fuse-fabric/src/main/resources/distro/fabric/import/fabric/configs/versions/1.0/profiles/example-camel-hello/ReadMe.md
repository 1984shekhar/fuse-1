# Example Camel Hello

This is the _Hello World_ example for using Camel inside Fuse.

This profile executes some Camel routes which are stored directly in the Profile configuration; so it can be changed easily inside a Fabric without needing to perform a code release.

For example you can edit the Camel routes directly in the management console and perform rolling updates of the changes across containers using Fuse Fabric.
